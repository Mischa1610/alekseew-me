# alekseew
Web App for my blog / CV and topics about me. This project should tell a bit about me, Michael Alekseew, as a person and developer. Also I want to try out some library, frameworks, plugins, ... with this repo. I will start with Angular, Angular Material, Angular CDK, Lottie-Web Animations, Server Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal and hosting on FireBase.
