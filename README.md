This repository contains a Web App for my blog / CV and topics about me.
This project should tell a bit about me, Michael Alekseew, as a person and developer.

Also I want to try out some libraries, frameworks, plugins, concepts, architectures, ... with this repo.
Following are currently inculded:

- GitFlow
- Angular
- Typescript
- Angular Material
- Angular CDK
- Prettier
- Standard-Version
- Commitizen
- Husky
- Lottie-Web Animations
- Server Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal
- hosting on FireBase
- Travis
- Greenkeeper

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed beforehand:
* **Node.js**
* **NPM**

## Dependencies

To install all needed dependencies just run:
```shell
npm install
```
This also setup's up the git commit message template (and set the wip package to use commitizen).
